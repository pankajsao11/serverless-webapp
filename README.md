# serverless-webapp

Overview: This serverless web application is designed to handle user registrations. It leverages AWS services to ensure scalability, low maintenance, and cost-efficiency. The main components include AWS Lambda for backend processing, API Gateway for routing and managing API requests, DynamoDB for storing user data, and CloudWatch Logs for monitoring and debugging.
