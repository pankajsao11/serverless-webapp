Overview: This serverless web application is designed to handle user registrations. It leverages AWS services to ensure scalability, low maintenance, and cost-efficiency. The main components include AWS Lambda for backend processing, API Gateway for routing and managing API requests, DynamoDB for storing user data, and CloudWatch Logs for monitoring and debugging.

Components:

AWS Lambda:

Purpose: Acts as the backend processing logic for handling registration requests.
Functionality: Validates input, processes the registration logic, and stores user data in DynamoDB.


API Gateway:
Purpose: Serves as the entry point for HTTP requests to the Lambda function.
Functionality: Routes HTTP POST requests to the Lambda function.

DynamoDB:
Purpose: Stores user registration data.
Functionality: Provides scalable and high-speed storage for user data.

CloudWatch Logs:
Purpose: Monitors and logs Lambda function execution for debugging and performance analysis.
Functionality: Automatically captures logs generated by the Lambda function.

IAM Role and Policies:
Purpose: Grants necessary permissions to the Lambda function.
Functionality: Ensures Lambda can interact with DynamoDB and log to CloudWatch.

This setup creates a scalable and maintainable serverless registration form using AWS services, all managed through Terraform for easy deployment and infrastructure-as-code best practices.
